paper presents viable strategy for using certificates for authentication with IoT
focuses on the DTLS protocol

full certificate based handshake takes 15 messages
may exceed frame size of IEEE 802.15.4

additional overhead results from the need to verify the validity of the certificate (may need to do time sync)

signature verification and DH key areement dominate crypto operation time for DTLS

cryptographic per handshake overheads add 15 seconds for certificate based DTLS

initial experiments find significant overhead added when using certificate based DTLS

------------

article proposes allowing a gateway to verify certificate chain

article proposes only performing expensive operations once during handshake. causes slight increase in memory usage

also proposes that the IoT devices themselves do not perform the initial handshake. expenisve operations are performed on other device
