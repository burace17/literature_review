- interoperable security
	- infeasible that IoT implements all security protocols in all layers
	 - signel security protocol suite that provides full security service should be standardized.


- Constrained Application Protocol
	- greatly reduces overhead over HTTP
	- reduces latency on low power networks 
	- uses UDP
	- use DTLS for security

- DTLS

- most want to reuse existing protocols to protect IoT, but they require adaptation
- DTLS receives most attention

- p.6 Wouters proposal about DTLS handshake

-----

- feasible to use DTLS for end-to-end security

- literature questions if these specialized standards are necessary 
	- points to mobile phone industry. phones got powerful enough to not need specialized standards
