- gives security requirements at each level of the architecture
- gives status of research for various security mechanisms:
	- encryption: not much research has been done yet.
	- communication security/protocols: need to research better preventative measures for DDoS and disaster recovery.
	- protect data at preception layer: research is of a lower demand because security at that layer cannot be increased easily. 
		- privacy is another major concern at this layer.
	- crypto algorithms:
		- details the use cases for major algorithms
		- need more research

- other challenges:
