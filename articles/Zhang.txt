- auth options need to be simple

security threats in two categories:
- first, similar to conventional networking
	- against confidentiality
	- integrity and availability
	- IoT at times collects sensitive data
	- information may disclose user information


Naming, identification, auth:

- current security feature: Bluetooth - pairing: password required - then data is transmitted using encryption

- naming challenge: massive scale, objects more complex. conventional naming not sufficient


auth model:

pairing:
	- password or PSK exchanged
	- mechanisms to prevent eavesdropping
	

auth by gateway
	- uses gateway between devices
	- research being done using COAP, DTLS for security.
	- cons: single point of failure, bottlenecking
	- 

auth by security token
- gateway gives a security token to the devices. may have a TTL
- peers exchange data using token
- cons: still a single failure point, design of token may be difficult

auth by trust chain
- chain of trust: peer A trusts peer B, etc.
- cons: more complex, may not work on low power devices

auth by global trust tree
