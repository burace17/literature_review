- protocol and network security:
	- devices must have a secure comm channel with more powerful devices
	- "cryptography is the cornerstone for network infrastructure protection"
	- some devices are not powerful enough to use complex encryption algorithms

- current research:
	- lists mature and work in progress standards
	- government recommendations
	- more work is necessary 
	- provides overview of encryption methods 
	-
