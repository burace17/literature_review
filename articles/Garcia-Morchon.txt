Host identitiy protocol 
	- allow for DH key exchange
	- two handshakes
		- HIP Base Exchange (BEX) uses public key crypto
		- HIP Diet Exchange (DEX) lightweight, static DH, for constrained devices

DTLS
	- TLS over UDP
	- mandatory standard for protection of COAP messages


paper proposes solution to securing IoT with focus on
- secure network access
- key management
- secure communication

contributions:
- proposed HIP-PSK
- uses both HIP and DTLS
- integration of AMIKEY

findings:
- HIP is smaller in  memory footprint
- HIP has less communication overhead
- DTLS allows for better interoperability but compromises efficiency
