COAP proposes the use of DTLS
DTLS initially designed for traditional networks 
literature proposes 6LOWPAN header compression. 
authors intend to develop a fully optimized implementation of DTLS for COAP

DTLS
- heavy overhead for IoT applications
- important to minimize code size and messages
- denial of service attacks are possible but mitigated through the use of stateless cookies
- handshakes are the most expenisve part of the protocol
- reestablishing connections is very inefficient
- authors adopt a caching strategy to store security associations that are frequently used

experiment:
- authors optimized modular arithmetic on large integers
- used an ECC library 

results:
- reduced ROM occupancy by almost 23%
