single malicious host can use handshake to cause DoS
article uses HIP DEX 
proposes protocol extensions for HIP DEX

uses puzzle based mechanisms to verify connection before doing handshake


HIP DEX issue:
DH operations have high overhead


Solutions:
- reduce public key based operations by saving and resuming existing sessions.
- propose attack detection strategy to prevent denial of service attack against expensive operations
- propose adaptive retransmission strategy

possible attacks:
replay attacks - session resumption
DoS attacks - session ticket
